# Minor-Project
This is the minor project-1
In this we are building a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, S3 bucket and AWS API Gateway
It will be a web application that would resize images in a fly!
Methadology:
The user will upload the image into the S3 bucket. As soon as the user clicks resie button, the api in the API gateway gets initiated.

1) Abstract:
"A picture is worth a thousand words" is a common adage around the world meaning that a single still image can convey multiple ideas and its meaning more effectively than a verbal description. Before images, the internet was a text-only tundra. Today images are an integral part of any website. They serve both as eye candy as well as informational tools. 
With the explosion of device types used to access the Internet with different capabilities, screen sizes, and resolutions, developers must provide images in an array of sizes to ensure a great user experience. Our project intends to simplify this by leveraging AWS cloud services and its serverless architecture.
