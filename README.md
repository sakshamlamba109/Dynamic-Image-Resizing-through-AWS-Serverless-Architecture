# Minor-Project
This is the minor project-1
In this we are building a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, S3 bucket and AWS API Gateway
It will be a web application that would resize images in a fly!
Methadology:
The user will upload the image into the S3 bucket. As soon as the user clicks resie button, the api in the API gateway gets initiated.
